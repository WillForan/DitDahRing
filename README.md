# MorseKeyboard
A Morse Code input method for Android
## Installation
I'll get to this when I know what I should say.
## Usage
Tap Morse code into the only button currently implemented.

A dit or "." is currently set to .2 seconds. This will be configurable in a later update. A dah, dash, or, "-" is 3 dit periods. Dits and dahs are separated by the period of one dit. Letters are separated by 3 dit periods and words are separated by 5 dit periods.

Swipe left for backspace. This is currently very unreliable. It generally enters "e" a lot because it interprets your increasingly frustrated swiping as a single dit. I suspect it has to do with only having one button. I might be able to fix it by resizing the button or I might just use a different method because swiping isn't the most convenient.
## Planned Features
- Capitalization
- Punctuation
- Prosigns to implement behavior such as "repeat last word", "end transmission" (close keyboard and send), and newline
- [Abbreviations](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code_abbreviations), possibly with configuration options
## Possible Features
I will probably never get to these but they'd be cool.
- Automatic timing detection
- Automatic capitalization and formatting of punctuation
- Non-English characters
